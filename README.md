**Mail spam detection**
In this project I triened a simple machine learning model to classify emails as being either spam or ham (a simple legitimate email) in Python using psych and nltk which is the natural language toolkit.
I used a Kaggle data set called "Spam MAils Dataset" which contains a text as a content and a label whether the email is spam or ham  that we can pre-process, vectorize and also make it numerical.

Used packages :
Pnadas , Numpy, nltk,scikit-learn
I used a RandomeForestClassifier model.
